  <p> <h3>
    Hi, I‘m Claudia.
I‘m a visual Designer with a passion for branding and a approaching UI designer and I‘m thrilled, to make the world a little bit more beautiful and easier with intuitive consistent designs and logical processes.
With my many years as a freelance media designer and marketing professional I bring a diverse background in terms of understanding and communication of customer needs in good design solutions.
My goal is always to provide fast and effective, high quality results for complex tasks.
I am looking for opportunities to improve myself and use my skills to create beautiful and simplifying solutions to specific problems.
I am a loyal and reliable person, who works independently and organized, with attention to detail and an eye for the feasible, and who is willing to get involved, learn and improve, looking for opportunities to
improve myself and use my skills to create beautiful and simplifying solutions to specific problems.
I‘m almost a dinosaur, but I‘m just getting started..
