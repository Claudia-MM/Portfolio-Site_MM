        Healthy eating... What does that even mean? Nowadays there are at least as many opinions as there are eating styles. Vegetarian,
vegan, paleo, gluten-free, low-fat, low-carbohydrate...
There is nothing that someone hasn't already called good
or healthy food. So what it means to eat healthily is something everyone has to
decide for themselves. Good nutrition is undoubtedly one of the
of the good things in life.
For this student research project, I decided to create a recipe app. I like to cook, I'm interested in international dishes and I try to eat healthy and high-quality food.
In the medium term, I would like to develop an app from this based on similar needs:
An app that focuses on healthy eating, simple dishes, optional health tips and home
home remedies for illnesses, that takes into account health restrictions and is written by
by experts.
Further options:
Own profile with the possibility to save recipes (own cookbook), post recipes (photo,
video), post and rate recipes, create a menu for a week (with shopping list), different categories
categories (inspiration, breakfast - lunch - dinner, special occasions, seasonal...), tips for everyday life
tips for everyday life, health tips & prevention, step-by-step explanation, search function, calories
and other health values, attractive pictures and clear design, free of charge.
